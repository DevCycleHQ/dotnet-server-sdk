# DevCycle .NET Cloud Server SDK

Welcome to the DevCycle .NET Cloud Server SDK. All calls to the client will send requests to DevCycle for user-specific configuration to to determine if a user receives a specific variation.

## Installation
Download the SDK from Nuget - https://www.nuget.org/packages/DevCycle.SDK.Server.Cloud

## Getting Started
Use the example app [`DevCycle.SDK.Server.Cloud.Example`.](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/dotnet-server-sdk/tree/main/DevCycle.SDK.Server.Cloud.Example) It will read your DevCycle SDK key from an environment variable `DEVCYCLE_SDK_TOKEN`

Your DevCycle SDK key can be found via [Environments & Keys Settings](https://www.devcycle.com/r/environments) on the DevCycle dashboard.
